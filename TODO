Avoid the following bug:
	1. cookie expires
	2. new story posted
	3. get feed without cookies, lose protected stories
	4. modified-since changes
	5. refresh cookie
	6. get feed with cookies.

Since the modified-since didn't change even though the cookies did, you have to
wait until a new story is posted to get back all the protected stories. I think
the only fix for this is to make modified-since dependent on the cookies of the
site. If the cookies change, the modified-since needs to be invalidated.

There should be two UI modes: "RSS" mode, and "LJ" mode, for lack of better
names. RSS mode should list each feed individually, which ones have unread
stories, et cetera. LJ mode should have all of the stories from all of the feeds
flat and in time order.

-----

It needs to reload feeds on its own, at per-feed configurable intervals.
